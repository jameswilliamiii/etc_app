      <p>Dear Friend:</p>
      <p>
        As you know, the role of social media in our society is ever changing and becoming increasingly more important. The power of social media can save a failing business, raise awareness for a cause and even help win an election. The more powerful social media becomes, the more important it is to embrace it and learn how to use its power to benefit our community.

        Social Media Week, September 22Â­26, reminds us that "The Future is Now." Embracing that theme, the Elgin Technology Center (ETC) has partnered with Social Media Week Chicago to present a week of free educational opportunities to Fox Valley businesses. These workshops will help businesses better utilize social media to positively impact awareness and sale. You can see a list of the <%= link_to 'scheduled workshops here', classes_url %>.
